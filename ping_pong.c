 *    This program demonstrates the use of setjmp, longjmp, setitimer, and sigaction

 *    is used to define the starting point for each 'thread', longjmp is used to
 *    perform a non-local goto to the 'thread' starting point, and setitimer/sigaction
 *    is used to switch back and forth between the 'threads' periodically.
