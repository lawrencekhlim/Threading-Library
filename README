Tested on CSIL machines and passes all four tests.



pthread_create calls an initialize function the first time it is called. It chooses the new thread id, creates a new stack, sets up the buffer and jump buf and and calls set jmp.

pthread_exit clears the memory of the stack (if it isn't the main thread), sets the thread as inactive, and changes threads.

signal_handler calls setjmp and changes threads

pthread_self returns the current thread id.
